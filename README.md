# The Paws of Time
Embark on an adventure in 'The Paws of Time,' a 2D precision platformer game where you play as a cat navigating through a dense, mysterious forest filled with challenging and mind-bending platforming puzzles.

Time plays a huge role in the game. By pressing 'G', all objects, and even music, start going back in time. Make sure to use this short window to your advantage.

Inspired by the legendary games like Celeste and Donkey Kong. The Paws of Time challenges your reflexes, your logical thinking, and your "time management".
